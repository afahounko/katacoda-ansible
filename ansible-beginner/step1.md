Check the prerequisites and create our working directory to organise our ansible roles and playbooks.

## Prerequisites

Check the version of `ansible`  with the following command:

`ansible --version`{{execute}}

You will see the version of Ansible
```
$ ansible --version
ansible 1.9.6
  configured module search path = None
```

### Working directory

Let's organise our work by creating our working directory

`mkdir  learn-ansible`{{execute}}

`cd  learn-ansible`{{execute}}

Now we are ready to start our workshop.
